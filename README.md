# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of Logistic Regression built from scratch using NumPy. The model uses scikit-learn only for Label Encoding and Train-Test splitting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn (for data preprocessing only)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Faizanfarhad/Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch.git
cd Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
